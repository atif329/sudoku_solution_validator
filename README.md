Operating Systems course project using multi threading

User can play sudoku after selecting the difficulty level. Hints and saving option is also available. Submitted solution will be validated and compared by the previous best scores. Username will be asked  if he made a high score. If we have an incomplete sudoku, which we want to solve, we can enter the incomplete solution in the Solve Sudoku screen, and click the solve button. The program uses a backtracking algorithm, to solve an incomplete solution. If there is an invalid value in the sudoku, we can click the Check button to highlight the wrong value. The third component is to validate a complete sudoku solution, in the Validate Sudoku option. Enter a complete solution and click Validate to check the solution. If invalid, the values can be highlighted using the Check button.
